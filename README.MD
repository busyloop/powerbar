# PowerBar

This is PowerBar - The last progressbar-library you'll ever need.

## Features

* Detects when stdout is not a terminal and automatically falls back to logging
  * Does not clutter your log-files with ansi-codes!
  * If your CLI-app can run interactively and non-interactively (e.g. cronjob)
    you will automatically get reasonable progress-output in both modes.
  * By default prints to stderr but can call any output-method
    of your choice (e.g. your favorite Logger).

* Fully customizable; all output is template-driven.

* All output is optional. You may set PowerBar to silently collect progress
  information (percentage-done, throughput, ETA, etc.) and then use the
  computed values elsewhere in your app.

* All state can be updated at any time. For example: If you're monitoring a
  multi-part operation then you can change the status-message of a running
  PowerBar to reflect the current state.

## Installation

`gem install powerbar`

## Getting Started

Watch the demo that was installed along with the gem:

`powerbar-demo`

Then look at the [source-code](https://github.com/busyloop/powerbar/blob/master/bin/powerbar-demo) of the demo. Pretty much all use-cases are covered in there, including templates and how to hook in your own logger.


## Example (for the impatient)

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'powerbar'

total = 100000
step = 1000

p = PowerBar.new

# Override some defaults to demonstrate how the settings work
p.settings.tty.finite.template.barchar = '*'
p.settings.tty.finite.template.padchar = '.'

# Dummy loop to simulate some progress
(0..total).step(step).each do |i|
  p.show(:msg => 'DEMO 1 - Ten seconds of progress', :done => i, :total => total)
  sleep 0.1
end
p.close
```
